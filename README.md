# Git Email Change Script

This repository contains a shell script that facilitates the process of changing email addresses in the commit history of a Git repository. The script allows you to update both the user and author email addresses, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the commit metadata.

By running this script, you can easily migrate and update email addresses associated with previous commits, providing a clean and uniform history for your Git repository.

Please note that this script modifies the commit history, and it's essential to have a backup of your repository before proceeding with the email address changes.

Instructions:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the shell script with the old and new email addresses as parameters.
3. The script updates the local Git configuration and changes all commits with the old email address to the new email address.

Ensure you understand the implications and consult the README for detailed usage instructions and any additional considerations.

Contributions and feedback are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests with improvements or suggestions.
